# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Support for GL703GE keyboard layout
### Changed
- Better handling of `/etc/asusd` not existing
- Better handling of non-existant config files
- Move all config handling to generic traits for better consistency
- Re-parse all configs to RON format
- Move fan-curve config to own config file
- Added option to set `disable_nvidia_powerd_on_battery`
- Add short log entry to throttle_thermal_policy change detection
- ROGCC: Don't notify user if changing to same mux mode
- ROGCC: Add CLI opt for loading a keyboard layout for testing, with live-reload on file change
- ROGCC: Add CLI opt for viewing all layout files + filenames to help find a layout matching your laptop
  + Both of these options would hopefully be temporary and replaced with a "wizard" GUI helper
- Fix profile controller not detecting if platform_profile is changed
- Fix remove the leftover initial config writes on `new()` for some controllers to prevent resetting settings on startup 
### BREAKING
- Rename aura dbus method from `per_key_raw` to `direct_addressing_raw` and add doc comment
- Changes to aura.conf:
- Changes to asusd-ledmodes.toml:
  + Rename `standard` to `basic_modes`
  + Rename `multizone` to `basic_zones`
  + Raname `per_key` to `advanced` and change type from `bool` to `AdvancedAuraType`
  + Removed `prod_family`
  + Split all entries to `board_name` (separating `board_names`) (now a huge file)
  + removed `asusd-ledmodes.toml` in favour of `aura_support.ron` due to an unsupported type in toml
- Rename and adjust `LedSupportedFunctions` to closely match the above

## [v4.5.8]
### Changed
- Fix incorrect stop/start order of nvidia-powerd on AC plug/unplug

## [v4.5.7]
### Changed
- ROGCC: Don't notify user if changing to same mux mode
- 

## [v4.5.7]
### Changed
- ROGCC: Don't notify user if changing to same mux mode
- asusd: don't block on systemd-unit change: removes all shoddy external command calls in favour of async dbus calls

## [v4.5.6]
### Changed
- Fix tasks not always running correctly on boot/sleep/wake/shutdown by finishing the move to async
- Change how the profile/fan change task monitors changes due to TUF laptops behaving slightly different
- ROGCC: Better handle the use of GPU MUX without supergfxd
- ROGCC: Track if reboot required when not using supergfxd
- Add env var for logging levels to daemon and gui (`RUST_LOG=<error|warn|info|debug|trace>`)
- ROGCC: Very basic support for running a command on AC/Battery switching, this is in config at `~/.config/rog/rog-control-center.cfg`, and for now must be edited by hand and ROGCC restarted (run ROGCC in BG to use effectively)
  + Run ROGCC from terminal to see errors of the AC/Battery command
  + Support for editing via ROGCC GUI will come in future
  + This is ideal for userspace tasks
- asusd: Very basic support for running a command on AC/Battery switching, this is in config at `/etc/asusd/asusd.conf`. A restart of asusd is not required if edited.
  + This is ideal for tasks that require root access (BE SAFE!)
- The above AC/Battery commands are probably best set to run a script for more complex tasks
- asusd: check if nvidia-powerd enabled before toggling

## [v4.5.5]
### Changed
- remove an unwrap() causing panic on main ROGCC thread

## [v4.5.4]
### Changed
- ROGCC:: Allow ROGCC to run without supergfxd
- ROGCC: Tray/notifs now reads dGPU status directly via supergfx crate (supergfxd not required)
- Add rust-toolchain to force minimum rust version

## [v4.5.3]
### Changed
- Adjust how fan graph in ROGCC works, deny incorrect graphs
- Fix to apply the fan curve change in ROGCC to the correct profile

## [v4.5.1]
### Added
- Support for FA506IE LED modes (Author: Herohtar)
### Changed
- Add a basic system tray with dGPU status and gpu mode switch actions
- Fixup some notifications in ROGCC
- Add config options for notifications for ROGCC
- Share states with tray process in ROGCC
- Share tates with tray process in ROGCC

## [v4.5.0]
### Added
- intofy watches on:
  - `charge_control_end_threshold`
  - `panel_od`
  - `gpu_mux_mode`
  - `platform_profile`
  - keyboard brightness
  - These allow for updating any associated config and sending dbus notifications.

  - `SetDgpuDisable`
  - `NotifyDgpuDisable`
  - `EgpuEnable`
  - `SetEgpuEnable`

  - `MainsOnline` (This is AC, check if plugged in or not)
  - `NotifyMainsOnline`
- `nvidia-powerd.service` will now enable or disable depending on the AC power state
  and on resume/boot (hybrid boot). It has been proven that this nvidia daemon can be
  problematic when on battery, not allowing the dgpu to suspend within decent time and
  sometimes blocking it completely.
- Notification to rog-control-center of dGPU state change
### Changed
- Use loops to ensure that mutex is gained for LED changes.
- asusctl now uses tokio for async runtime. This helps simplify some code.

  - `ChargeControlEndThreshold`
  - `SetChargeControlEndThreshold`
  - `NotifyChargeControlEndThreshold`

- Support for per-key config has been added to `asusd-user`. At the moment it is
  basic with only a few effects done. Please see the manual for more information.
- Support for unzoned and  per-zone effects on some laptops. As above.
- Added three effects to use with Zoned or Per-Key:
  + Static, Breathe, Flicker. More to come.
- Support for G713RS LED modes
- Support for TUF laptop RGB (kernel patches required, these are submitted upstream)
### Changed
- Create new rog-platform crate to manage all i/o in a universal way
  + kbd-led handling (requires kernel patches, TUF specific)
  + platform handling (asus-nb-wmi)
  + power (basic, can be extended in future)
  + hidraw
  + usbraw
- Refactor how ROGCC handles IPC for background open, run-in-bg
- Refactor daemon task creation to be simpler (for development)
- Rename dpu_only to gpu_mux. Update all related messages and info.
### Breaking
- DBUS: rename path `/org/asuslinux/RogBios` to `/org/asuslinux/Platform`
- DBUS: renamed `dedicated_graphic_mode` to `gpu_mux_mode` (`GpuMuxMode`)
- DBUS: renamed `set_dedicated_graphic_mode` to `set_gpu_mux_mode` (`SetGpuMuxMode`)
  + The methods above take an enum: 0 = Discrete, 1 = Optimus
